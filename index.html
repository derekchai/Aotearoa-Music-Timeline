                    The "Dunedin Sound" is a term for a movement cultural as
                    much as it was musical, emerging in the 1980s and a defining
                    factor of Dunedin's music scene. While potentially equivocal
                    in its existence <cite>(Mills 2021, 19–20)</cite> and
                    certainly overwhelmingly white and male-dominated
                    <cite>(Bannister 2006, xiii)</cite>, it nevertheless cannot
                    be denied that the movement has had a lasting impact on the
                    Southern city.

                <p>
                    Hallmarks of the so-called "Sound" include
                    jangly guitars and droning notes <cite>(Schmidt
                        2016)</cite>, and the subgenre itself, born from punk
                    and post-punk, is regarded to have spurred on the
                    development of adjacent genres such as alternative and indie
                    rock.

                            The formation of the Dunedin Sound is attributed to
                            the Southern city's isolation

                            Ōtepoti and the cultural centres of Western music in
                            the UK and US by which the movement was so
                            influenced cannot be denied.
