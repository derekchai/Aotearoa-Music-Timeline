            The "Dunedin Sound" is a term for a musical and cultural movement 
            which emerged in the 1980s. With roots in punk rock and spurring the
            development of genres such as alternative rock, it played an
            influential role in not only Dunedin's music scene, but also that of
            New Zealand's and the whole world.
