                The "Dunedin Sound" is a term for a movement cultural as
                much as it was musical, emerging in the 1980s and a defining
                factor of Dunedin's music scene. While potentially equivocal
                in its existence<cite> (Mills 2021, 19–20)</cite> and
                certainly overwhelmingly white and male-dominated<cite>
                    (Bannister 2006, xiii)</cite>, it nevertheless cannot
                be denied that the movement has had a lasting impact on the
                Southern city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hallmarks of the so-called "Sound" include
                jangly guitars and droning notes<cite> (Schmidt
                    2016)</cite>, and the subgenre itself, born from punk
                and post-punk, is regarded to have spurred on the
                development of adjacent genres such as alternative and indie
                rock.

                        The formation of the Dunedin Sound is attributed to
                        the Southern city's isolation<cite> (Chapman 2024,
                            20)</cite> almost as much as
                        this same

                        the UK and US by which the movement was so
                        influenced cannot be denied.

                        Funnily enough, the punk movement, the Dunedin Sound's
                        predecessor, found its New Zealand roots in
                        Auckland<cite> (Russell 2017, 2)</cite>. Imported from
                        the punk revolution in Europe (from the UK especially
                        so), 1977 saw the formation of Auckland's, and indeed
                        New Zealand's first two punk bands: The Scavengers, and
                        the Suburban Reptiles<cite> (Grigg 2019)</cite>, formed
                        at Auckland Technical Institute (now Auckland University
                        of Technology) and the University of Auckland,
                        respectively.

                        At the heart of Auckland's punk scene was the nightclub
                        Zwines. Located on Durham Lane off Queen Street in the
                        Auckland CBD<cite> (Shute 2023)</cite>, it was a nexus
                        for the punk and youth subculture from its opening in
                        1978 before its interior was ravaged by fire in
                        1979<cite> (Shute 2023)</cite>.

                The Dunedin Sound shared a lot of similarities with the punk
                movement. The countercultural anti-establishmentarianism of the
                scene was a direct attack upon "artifice"<cite> (Robertson 1991,
                    18)</cite> and the pre-existing "&nbsp;'muso' scene"<cite>
                    (Knox, quoted in Schmidt 2013)</cite> and these notions
                would eventually give way to the DIY ethos prevailing within the
                Dunedin Sound<cite> (Robertson 1991, 19)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, punk manifested itself in vastly different ways in
                Dunedin and Auckland. While voguish and fast-paced Auckland was
                more accepting of the fashion and cultural trends coming from
                New Zealand's antipodean centres, Dunedinite attitudes were more
                cynical to these emerging concepts<cite> (Robertson 1991,
                    21)</cite>, and so, the divergence between punk and the
                Dunedin Sound.
